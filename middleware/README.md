# MIDDLEWARE

**This directory is not required, you can delete it if you don't want to use it.**

This directory contains your application middleware.
Middleware let you define custom functions that can be run before rendering either a page or a group of pages.
<!-- It's good for redirecting users that aren't authenticated, etc. -->

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/routing#middleware).
